# Virtual PAC - Centralized Protection, Automation, and Control for Power Substations

This repository contains the source code and related resources for the Virtual PAC project, an initiative that explores the evolution of information technologies in transforming power substations. The main objective is to address the challenges posed by the increasing use of renewable sources and the complexity of the modern power grid, utilizing the innovative concept of Centralized Protection, Automation, and Control (PAC Virtual), based on smart grids and the IEC 61850 standard.

## Overview

The evolution of power substations is crucial to meet the growing demands of the electrical infrastructure, driven by the transition to renewable energy sources. The proposed Virtual PAC in this work is based on the virtualization of protection and control devices in the substation, providing hardware independence. This results in increased flexibility, cost reduction, and simplified maintenance.

## Key Features

1. **Virtualization of IEDs (Intelligent Electronic Devices):** Implementation of virtual devices performing protection and automation functions, following the guidelines of the IEC 61850 standard.

2. **Virtual Simulator/Controller:** Development of a virtual simulator/test set to perform basic tests of the IEC 61850 standard protocols, enabling verification of system interoperability and performance.

## Contributions

The main contributions of this work include:

- Conception and implementation of the Virtual PAC system, integrating smart grid principles and the IEC 61850 standard.
- Development of virtual IEDs to perform critical protection and automation functions.
